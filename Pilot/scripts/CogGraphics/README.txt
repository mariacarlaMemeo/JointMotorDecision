To install Cogent Graphics do the following...

copy the CogGphTB folder to your MATLAB 
toolbox folder.  Then run MATLAB and add the
folder to the MATLAB path.

That's it, all done.  The Doc folder contains 
the Cogent Graphics manuals and some other
files which are used for some examples in the
manuals.  The Samples folder contains some
demonstration MATLAB scripts which show off 
some of the capabilities of Cogent Graphics.
